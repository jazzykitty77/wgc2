FIrst website built for a client. 
Correcting the uploaded file locations. 
I had to upload this site many times. Let's see if it works this time. 
Site is working. Various tweaks listed in notes. 
Moved DONATE button to more prominent location. 
Attempted to pad "MEDIA OUTREACH" h1 header. Div would not respond to commands for some reason. 
Added a THANK YOU page for the PayPal redirect after confirmation.
